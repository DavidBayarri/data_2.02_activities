Keep working on the bank database. (In case you need to load data again, refer to files_for_lessons_and_activities to get the database.)

- Select those loans whose contract finished and not paid back. Return the debt value from the status you identified in the last activity, together with loan id and account id.
- Calculate the urban population for all districts. Hint: You are looking for the number of inhabitants and the % of urban inhabitants in each district. Return columns as district_name and urban_population.
- On the previous query result - rerun it but filtering out districts where the rural population is greater than 50%.
