Keep on using the Bank Database 

Get the biggest and the smallest transaction with non-zero values in the database (use the trans table in the bank database).

Get account information with an extra column year showing the opening year as 'YY'. Eg., 1995 will show as 95. Hint: Look at the first two characters of the string date in the account table. You would have to use function substr. Google is your friend.
